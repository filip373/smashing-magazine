        <h1>Web Development Reading List #141: jQuery 3, Chillout.js, And How Technology Shapes Society</h1>

      <p>There are weeks where I don't find articles for the "Going Beyond" section of the Web Development Reading List at all. And then there are weeks like this one, where two brilliant pieces show up that reveal so much about how we live together with new technology and how this shapes our society.</p>
      <img src="assets/images/the-self-fulfilling-prohesy-opt.png" alt="The self fulfilling prophesy">
      <p>Along with a bunch of good tech articles, a great way to leave you for the next two weeks. Please note that I'll be away on vacation next week, so there won't be a summary next Friday.</p>

        <h1>Find A Friend, Boost Your Creativity, And Make Your Digital Dream Come True</h1>

      <p>Are you passionate about something? Do you have a secret project? Not something that will change the world (though who knows?), but will definitely change you? Do you have a friend who complements your skills? Has anyone recently asked you for help with their project? Do you just have a digital dream, or is there also a plan to make it come true?</p>
      <img src="assets/images/01-leave-your-comfort-zone-preview-opt.png" alt="Leave your comfort zone">
      <p>Every professional has something in common. It's called the comfort zone. The first sign you're in it is when you see no challenge on the horizon. You know pretty much everything you need to perform well, and if anything unfamiliar comes your way it can be solved fairly quickly. It can take a while to realize you've stopped moving, and working on freelance projects seems like the only way to keep your brain busy.</p>
